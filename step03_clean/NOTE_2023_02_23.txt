NOTE: 2/23/2023

I attempted to put all of the old files I'd generated for step 3 into a new directory- "old_processshortreads",
which would hold all the files generated with stacks::process_shortreads. I had to go back a step and
clean the files from step 2 again, which meant discarding the files generated with process_shortreads, but
in an attempt to keep them, it looks like the directories became merged somehow. So these are the files 
that should be in the plates1_2, plate3_r1, and plate3_r2 directories:

Plates 1-2
- fastp_pl1.sh
- slurm-3990342.out

Plate 3, run 1
- fastp_pl3_r1.sh
- slurm-4012812.out

Plate 3, run 2
- slurm-4012921.out
- clean_pl3_r2_fastp.sh
