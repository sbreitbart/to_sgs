Read 1226316766 BAM records:
  kept 665421709 primary alignments (54.6%), of which 334298337 reverse reads
  skipped 495399507 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (40.6%)
  skipped 18919329 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (1.6%)
  skipped 39422875 unmapped reads (3.2%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 4662801.4 records/sample (64388-13879141)
    kept 0.0%-79.6% of these

Built 48803 loci comprising 331123372 forward reads and 330918496 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 65.0 (sd: 22.7).

Genotyped 48803 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=399.0x, stdev=171.9x, min=1.3x, max=1111.6x
  mean number of sites per locus: 68.7
  a consistent phasing was found for 51090 of out 80203 (63.7%) diploid loci needing phasing
