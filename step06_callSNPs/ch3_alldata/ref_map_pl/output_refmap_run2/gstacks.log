Read 1226142485 BAM records:
  kept 665409400 primary alignments (54.6%), of which 334298168 reverse reads
  skipped 495307413 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (40.6%)
  skipped 18884337 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (1.5%)
  skipped 39388834 unmapped reads (3.2%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 4697863.9 records/sample (411657-13879141)
    kept 41.0%-79.6% of these

Built 48799 loci comprising 331111232 forward reads and 330918346 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 65.0 (sd: 22.7).

Genotyped 48799 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=401.9x, stdev=169.3x, min=39.7x, max=1111.5x
  mean number of sites per locus: 68.7
  a consistent phasing was found for 51088 of out 80198 (63.7%) diploid loci needing phasing
