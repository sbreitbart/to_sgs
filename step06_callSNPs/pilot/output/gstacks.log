Read 16647512 BAM records:
  kept 8738156 primary alignments (52.8%), of which 4390856 reverse reads
  skipped 7364657 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (44.5%)
  skipped 233985 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (1.4%)
  skipped 205608 unmapped reads (1.2%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 4161878.0 records/sample (3345647-5572027)
    kept 47.6%-61.0% of these

Built 7806 loci comprising 4347300 forward reads and 4344307 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 64.6 (sd: 22.4).

Genotyped 7806 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=284.4x, stdev=65.3x, min=199.9x, max=366.1x
  mean number of sites per locus: 65.9
  a consistent phasing was found for 776 of out 856 (90.7%) diploid loci needing phasing
