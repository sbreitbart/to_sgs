/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/avx2/Core/stacks/2.62/bin/gstacks -I bamfiles/ -M pop_map_pilot.txt -O output

Logging to 'output/gstacks.log'.
Locus/sample distributions will be written to 'output/gstacks.log.distribs'.

Configuration for this run:
  Input mode: reference-based
  Population map: 'pop_map_pilot.txt'
  Input files: 4, e.g. 'bamfiles/1.2_2E10_sorted.bam'
  Output to: 'output/'

Read 16647512 BAM records:
  kept 8738156 primary alignments (52.8%), of which 4390856 reverse reads
  skipped 7364657 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (44.5%)
  skipped 233985 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (1.4%)
  skipped 205608 unmapped reads (1.2%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 4161878.0 records/sample (3345647-5572027)
    kept 47.6%-61.0% of these

Built 7806 loci comprising 4347300 forward reads and 4344307 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 64.6 (sd: 22.4).

Genotyped 7806 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=284.4x, stdev=65.3x, min=199.9x, max=366.1x
  mean number of sites per locus: 65.9
  a consistent phasing was found for 776 of out 856 (90.7%) diploid loci needing phasing

Logging to 'output/populations.log'.
Locus/sample distributions will be written to 'output/populations.log.distribs'.
populations parameters selected:
  Percent samples limit per population: 0
  Locus Population limit: 1
  Percent samples overall: 0
  Minor allele frequency cutoff: 0
  Maximum observed heterozygosity cutoff: 1
  Applying Fst correction: none.
  Pi/Fis kernel smoothing: off

  Bootstrap resampling: off

Parsing population map...
The population map contained 4 samples, 3 population(s), 1 group(s).
Working on 4 samples.
Working on 3 population(s):
    5: 1.2_2E10_sorted, 1.2_2F11_sorted
    47: 1.2_2E11_sorted
    39: 1.2_2F10_sorted
Working on 1 group(s) of populations:
    defaultgrp: 5, 47, 39

Raw haplotypes will be written to 'output/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to 'output/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to 'output/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
